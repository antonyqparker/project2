************ParkFit************

Background

I decided to create Parkfit after my fondness of a type of exercise called Calisthenics.  It's exercise without weights 
and is normally practised outside in a park or wherever you like, but ideally not in a gym.  High gym membership prices and 
the prevelance of personal trainers also supurred me to design something that cuts both of these elements out as they 
both leave you penniless.

Functionality

The website is designed to allow users to create a workout routine based on a selection of exercises seeded from a database.
The user can then select each of the exercises and then post their own routine for other users to see.  Each of the exercises 
when clicked will show some text, instructing you on how to perform the exercise in case you need some help.  A routine 
created by user can be edited and deleted from the database.

What I Learnt

The biggest challenge with this project was developing the backend elements.  Ensuring that databases had the correct 
relationships was key in ensuring the stable functioanlity of the site so i had to get to grips with it quickly. Displaying 
the correct information from the database using embedded ruby was also something i learnt how to use more proficiently which 
also meant spending more time making sure the controllers are exactly how you want them to be.  More broadly, ensuring your
file strucutre and project organisation is to a high standard was something new as all previous projects have been small
and didn't require so many files.

What i would change/add

Given more time i would allow users to choose how many reps to do and how long a rest should be inbetween exercises using 
more form functionality.  The styling was changed rather last minute some i would have like to spend more time on making it 
a little more slick and modern.  Sourcing good photos was also a challenge so sourcing some more professional pics would have
great.
